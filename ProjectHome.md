The Echo Nest API allows analysis of music files based on the "Musical Brain".<br>
<br>
From the Echo Nest's web site : "The Echo Nest's APIs are based on the "Musical Brain", a one-of-a-kind machine learning platform that actually listens to music and reads about music from every corner of the web. We're using the Musical Brain to power enhanced music search, recommendations and interactivity for online music services."<br>
